Drop DOS support. This will simplify the build process.

Investigate additional CVEs:

* CVE-2018-20451
* CVE-2018-20453
* CVE-2023-41633
* CVE-2023-31979

Use full autoconf to create Makefiles. This will make it easier to build with
ASAN to reproduce CVE-2023-31979 (catdoc: buffer overflow in process_file() in
src/reader.c)
